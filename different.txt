What I've done different than the plan:
split up images into subdirectories to thread easily
needed to use PIL to convert to png, drop greyscale
needed to use essential generators to make random english sentences for secret messages
Turned into subdirs named w/ class labels for keras' imagedatagenerator

needed to only use ascii, non ascii made things very broken
